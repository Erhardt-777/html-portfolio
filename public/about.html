<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm aspiring web developer currently living in Canada. I have no experience in coding but I believe becoming a Web Developer would be a great start
  to pursue software development. If I were to be successful, I definetly can learn more complicated software languages. 
  I am eager to learn more of coding and create more exciting websites, then eventually create software, applications and more advance.</p>
